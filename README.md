Overview

This repository contains a weather prediction model implemented in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The machine learning model is based on Logistic Regression.

Requirements:

1.Python 3
2.Tkinter
3.sci-kit-learn

Features

1.Tkinter GUI: User-friendly interface for interacting with the weather prediction model.


2.Logistic Regression Model: The underlying machine learning model used for weather predictions.


3.Scikit-learn Integration: Leveraging the popular machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
